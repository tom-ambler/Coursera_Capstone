In their experiences, long conversions with someone who is hysterical or not capable of doing an on-scene assessment delays the appropriate course of action or leads to misguided decisions. Sending services for every accident is cost prohibitive. And, there\u2019s not enough time to wait for the police to arrive, assess and then phone in a request. "
